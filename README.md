# Big-Data-Analytics
This project simulates the MapReduce framework using a sample e-commerce transaction dataset (50+ records) in Microsoft Excel to analyze customer purchase patterns and product sales trends. The goal is to demonstrate how MapReduce logic (Map → key-value pairs, Reduce → aggregation) can be applied to extract business insights even without a distributed infrastructure.
